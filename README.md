# gray-isaac
An example mod for UnlockAPI

### Content
1) A character that gains 99 coins when defeating Mom's Heart/It Lives! (To showcase the MC_BEAT_REQUIREMENT custom callback)
2) An unlockable starting item (Gray D6) for that character by beating Mom's Foot
3) An unlockable tainted version of the character (to showcase locking tainteds and saving data)
4) An unlockable starting item (Gray Breakfast) for the tainted character by beating Mom's Foot & Hush
5) A custom challenge that starts you off with & unlocks an active item (Gray Yum Heart) (a showcase of the MC_PRE_CHANGE_HELD_COLLECTIBLE callback)
6) An example save manager, so you can understand when UnlockAPI data needs to be loaded & saved

**NOTE:** As this is an example, none of the items actually do anything
